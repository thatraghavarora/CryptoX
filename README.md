# CryptoX 🔗

> A WhatsApp-native crypto wallet powered by Hela Chain — send, receive, and manage HLUSD without ever leaving your chat.

---

## What is CryptoX?

CryptoX is a conversational crypto wallet that lives entirely inside WhatsApp. No app to download, no browser to open, no seed phrases to memorize. Just message the bot and you're in.

Built on **Hela Chain** with **HLUSD** as the native currency, CryptoX makes decentralized payments as simple as sending a text message. It automatically creates a non-custodial wallet for every new user, tied to their phone number.

---




## How it works

1. **Register** - Send any message to the bot. If you're new, it creates a Hela Chain wallet linked to your phone number instantly.
2. **Deposit** - The bot gives you your wallet address. Send HLUSD to it from any Hela Chain compatible wallet.
3. **Send money** - Type a recipient's phone number or wallet address, enter the amount, and the transaction is sent on-chain.
4. **Check balance**  Hit "-Check balance" and the bot fetches your live HLUSD balance directly from the blockchain.

All of this happens through natural WhatsApp button interactions — no commands to memorize.

```
User sends "hello"
    → Bot checks if user exists on Hela Chain smart contract
    → If new: generates keypair, AES-256 encrypts private key, registers on-chain via operator wallet
    → If existing: shows menu (Deposit / Send / Balance)
```

**Zero database dependency** — all user data and payment history is stored on-chain. Private keys are AES-256 encrypted before being written to the smart contract.

## Smart contract

Deployed on Hela Chain testnet:
`0x1AEd7744a43a464E344C44Cf1A78aBD3d41C40fD`

Functions:
- `registerUser(phone, name, wallet, encryptedPrivateKey)` - onboards a new user
- `getUser(phone)` - looks up a user by phone hash
- `createPaymentRequest(to, amount)` - records a confirmed payment permanently on-chain

## Setup & installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Meta Developer account with WhatsApp Cloud API access
- A funded Hela Chain testnet wallet (for operator gas)
- Hardhat (for contract deployment only)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parthverma-0/cryptoX.git
cd cryptoX
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root:

```env
META_WA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_meta_access_token
WA_BUSSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER=your_whatsapp_business_number
META_WA_WABA_ID=your_waba_id
META_WA_SENDER_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id
META_WA_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
HELA_RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.helachain.com
CRYPTOX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1AEd7744a43a464E344C44Cf1A78aBD3d41C40fD
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_encryption_key
OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_funded_wallet_private_key
PROD_URL=your_vercel_deployment_url
```

Generate an encryption key:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Get testnet HLUSD for your operator wallet:
```
https://testnet-faucet.helachain.com
```

### 3. Run locally

```bash
npm run start
```

### 4. Expose your local server

```bash
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Copy the generated URL and set it as your webhook in the Meta Developer Console under **WhatsApp → Configuration → Webhook URL**:

```
https://your-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com/api/whatsapp
```

### 5. Deploy to production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Add all environment variables in your Vercel dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**, then redeploy.
